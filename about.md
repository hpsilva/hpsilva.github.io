### Hello,

In the last period i have been fiddling around with some old ideas which i am currently exploring.

In this web site i am looking forward to develop content on those ideas and share knowledge and information.

My 



### my history

My name is xxx, during daytime I am a researcher/engineer in a company that is involved in printing business. The rest of the time I am a trader.
I studied applied physics with specialization in pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. My daily work involves anything from quick algorithm prototyping in Matlab and other languages to hardware design & programming.
Since 2009 I have been using my technical skills in financial markets. Before coming to the conclusion that Python is the best tool available, I was working extensively in Matlab, which is covered on my other blog.

### my history II

My name is xxx and I’m the human behind the robot. Using statistical and quantitative analysis, I develop, test and deploy algorithmic  trading systems.

An engineer by training and quantitative trader by passion, I primarily use a complimentary approach that combines model-based analysis with machine learning and data mining. This blog is primarily a means of documenting my learnings, generating ideas, fostering collaboration and connecting with like-minded people.

I trade my own systems using my own funds. I also do some proprietary trading on a contract basis and provide consulting services to assist with trading systems research, development and testing. If you are interested in working with me, please get in touch via the contact form in the sidebar.


### my history III

My name is xxxs.  I am a quantitative research analyst.

I was inspired to write this blog via interactions with Brian Peterson, Joshua Ulrich, and Kent Hoxsey, and professors I have interacted with at Stony Brook Quantitative Finance (Dr. Robert J. Frey and Dr. Andrew P. Mullhaupt)

This blog will be an investigation into various problems that interest me in quantitative finance and asset management.

You can find my github here.

I am committed to continuous learning in quantitative finance through online courses, books, and articles.

I am currently employed at a hedge fund. I have previously worked in quantitative analysis for trading, so-called ‘big data’ analytics, and asset management. I am interested in networking, and may be reached at my gmail address.

My LinkedIn profile is here.


### my history IV

I trade my own account using a portfolio of grey-box quantitative approaches. Most are completely systematic, but some also incorporate an element of discretion on my part. I generally avoid fundamentals and trade purely on technical factors, though I’m looking to change this in the future. Among others, I trade several major stock indices, individual stocks, volatility, volatility derivatives, and various spreads. I plan on using the blog to post about interesting things that come up in my research.

My toolbox includes MATLAB, Octave, R, as well as custom coded solutions in C++ and C#. For charting and some backtesting I use MultiCharts .NET.
