As we dive deeper in the technological era of all web things, it is the perfect time to look ahead in the future and get hand in the opportunities posed in the years to come.

How we get on tha troad to begin the journey is not as important as the when. We need to recognize that the first step will lead to the second, and so on... If we don't begin, the rest of the work will never get done, right? That is why probably great philosopher Plato once said that "You know the beginning is the most important part of any work, how can you accomplish great things if you never get started"?

All this and other similar quotes by incredible wise man, tell us similar thing: Don't wait for the right time, START NOW!

Should you be educating yourself if you start a business? Yes. But you do this things while going thru the process after getting started. Many people spend too much time over-educating themselves without acting on what they learn. Many people spend too much time getting ready or waiting for the perfect time. There will never be a perfect time. PErfection is impossible.

Plato would tell you to quit making excuses and start now. Until you start no progress will be made. This reminds me of how professional atheletes might says, you miss every opportunity you don't take. Massive action is the key to progress. You have to take it 

> Start by doing what is necessary; then do what's possible; suddenly you are doing the impossible
> St. Francis of Assis


> <p>You know that the beginning is the most important part of any work, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken....
> Plato, The Republic

As we begin the journey we are capable of doing just the necessary. We don't immedialtely have the means to know/do it all. Slowly as we put in the work, hours turn into days, days into months, fog lifts and we begin to recall our forsaken dreams and goals.
One day we realize it might be possible for us to achieve what we abandoned. As our dreams are reclaimed we become what we thought was impossible earlier.

If it would be easy, everyone would be doing it!!
