If you got thru my last article about <a href='http://hpsilva.io/2015-12-12-regular-expressions/'>RegEx</a>, you might got wondering on why i have addressed to regular expressions as 'difficult to grasp'.
Well, the reason being that on the previous article we just covered the <a href=''https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html>tool</a> Python provides on its standard library to deal with RegEx, however the examples covered were just introductory.

If you are curious about the power of what can get done with RegEx, just bear with me a bit more as i'll provide few more examples this time around focusing on regEx patterns..

### RegEx Patterns

To start with i should remark that there are various characters which would have special meaning for `Python` when they are used in regular expressions. 
To avoid any confusion while dealing with regEx, we shall make use of **raw strings** instead as `r'expression'`.
