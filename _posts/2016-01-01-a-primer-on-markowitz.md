## Intro

The capital asset pricing model (**CAPM**) of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) has been subject of great debate by academics and practitioners during the past half century, initially in the US and later on around the world. Due to its versatility, it has been widely used for solving problems as i.e. finding the fair cost of capital in financial markets,  provide a base for network regulation on utilities infrastructure, evaluate mutual funds’ performance, just to name a few. 

As such, many approaches have been done with CAPM model while seeking to improve its well-known anomalies. There is a great debate whether it should be extended with the most noticeable effects like size, value or factors which represent these anomalies. More on the subject, within the mutual fund performance evaluation, emerged a third effect – so called momentum – which is considered to be as well an explanatory variable. 
In response to the mentioned anomalies, some of the most prominent authors within the literature, and actually responsible to “formalize” the effects under an augmented CAPM model, are Fama and French (1993) author of the three factor model, and Carhart (1997) whom augmented Fama and French model to capture the momentum effect.

Being asset pricing models such a widely used tool, it was found that the scarce literature regarding Portugal aims mostly at analyzing market efficiency (Areal and Armada, 2002), risk premium and market risk beta (Carvalho and Barajas, 2011) and strategies based in the book to market ratio effects (Almas and Duques, 2008), therefore missing the multivariate models with ability to explore the aforementioned effects altogether.
To put into contect, Vieira, S. (2013) attempted to use the traditional Capital Asset Pricing Model (henceforth CAPM) and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (henceforth APT). They revealed that a drawback of their research was that data (dividends, price targets, etc.) was required to be curated manually from different sources, and possibly a potential explanation for lack of consistency in their findings. Hence they suggest further research to be conducted with other methods of asset pricing based solely on ready available data.
Minding the gap concerning limited research availability in one hand, and having obtained access to required data, this research motivation and objective is to identify which capital pricing theory better explains the returns on the Portuguese stock market. Within the selected models, minding data availability, it was chosen to work with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (**CAPM**), Fama-French three factors (**FFM**), and the Fama-French-Carhart four factors (**FFC**). As literature suggests, such models have been reason of long discussions in both academia and investment industry, as a consensus seems to have not been reached so far concerning the outcome of such techniques for diverse number of international markets.

In this research was used data from Euronext Lisbon Stock Exchange, in particular from “PSI Geral” index constituents, for the period starting from January 2000 until September 2015. Such data was used to investigate how the multivariate models perform when applied to the Portuguese stock market, as well it was scrutinized if firm characteristics like value, size or momentum are a good fit to augment CAPM model, as similarly done by Fama and French (1993) or Carhart (1997).

To carry on with the research, the methodology as adopted by Fama and French (1993) will be applied, based in the time series test of Black, Jensen and Scholes (1972), the cross sectional test from Fama and MacBeth (1973) and GMM multifactor test of Hansen (1982). The reason behind using the adopted methods, is that each is based in different assumptions and test objectives, hence providing different points of view around data, thus complementing each other.

At the next chapter the reader will be conducted thru the literature at hand on the elaboration of CAPM model up to the augmented versions of Fama and French, and Carhart’s models. Later on in chapter 3, the empirical study methodology will be presented based on methods adopted by Fama and French (1993), followed by the chapter where findings will be discerned.
