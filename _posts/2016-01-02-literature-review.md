##2.1 The Capital Asset Pricing Model

CAPM - or Capital Asset Pricing Model – emerged from the model developed by Markowitz, M. (1959), a model for portfolio selection. According to Markowitz’s model, a selection of a portfolio of stock at the time t - 1, will produce a return of random nature at time t. The model’s consideration is that an investor is risk averse, and while building its portfolio, the sole concern is the mean and variance characteristics of the investment return. Such portfolio selection is known as “mean-variance”, because it minimizes the variance of returns and on the other hand it maximize the potential return for the considered variance.

CAPM transforms the mathematical model of Markowitz into a framework where the relationship between risk and return can be somewhat predicted, considering an efficient portfolio selection. Sharpe (1964), and Lintner (1965), complemented Markowitz’s model with new assumptions to find the so called mean-variance efficient portfolios. In short, the first assumption is “complete agreement”, where investors agree on the distribution of returns between periods (t - 1 to t), and the second assumption relates to “borrowing and lending at a risk-free rate”, regardless amounts in use. 

In the figure 1 below are depicted the CAPM principles. Horizontal axis represent portfolio risk function of standard variation, whereas vertical axis represents expected return. Abc curve represent minimum variance frontier zone for risk assets, the zone of minimum variance in returns for a portfolio, considering a given risk and expected return. An investor seeking a high return, must bear with the respective high volatility associated – point a and c of the figure 1. Point T represent the lowest volatility zone for a respective return. Considering no risk free borrowing or lending, the zone along the line over point b in the abc curve represent the place where portfolios are efficient. 

**Figure 1** – Representation of the Capital Pricing Asset Model








Considering now the risk-free borrowing and lending situation, an investment made in a risk-free security, and at a risk-free rate, will be located in point Rf, free of risk and with no variance in its return. If an investor places part of its investment funds in a risk-free asset and the remaining funds in a portfolio located in point g, will result in the line Rf-g. The right side of g point along Rf-g line, represent the zone where there is a combination of risk free lending or borrowing mixed with risky asset portfolio g.
To find mean-variance efficient portfolios that are available with risk-free borrowing and lending, a line is plotted between Rf and the tangent point T to the abc curve. This line represent the situation where all the efficient portfolios are a combination of risk free assets, and a single risk portfolio located in T, as mentions Tobin (1958) in his separation theorem.
Having in mind the CAPM assumption of investor’s agreement concerning the distribution of returns, we have now represented in the Figure 1 an investment opportunity which is consensual across all investors, done by combining the tangent portfolio T with risk-free lending or borrowing. This situation will motivate investors to hold now a portfolio of risky assets based in portfolio T, considering that the portfolio assets selection is done by weighting individual securities market value against the total market value of risky assets market. So to say that considering CAPM assumptions, a portfolio T shall be located in the minimum variance frontier curve, also known as Market portfolio. Having a number of N risky assets and finding the minimum variance condition, we have:
E(Ri)=E(R_ZM )+ β_(i M)*[E(R_M )-E(R_ZM )],i=1…N
,where E(Ri) is the expected return on asset I, E(RZM) is the expected return on assets with market beta equal to zero, E(RM) represents expected market return and ΒiM  thebeta for asset I which can be found by obtaining the following relation:
β_iM=  (cov(R_i,R_M))/(〖σ^2 (R〗_M))
Observing the minimum variance model from above, can be added that the expected return on assets E(RZM) with market beta equal to zero, represent the return of such assets which do not have correlation with the market. Furthermore, β which is the market beta for an asset, is taken as the risk premium associated with risky assets. As beta can be found by performing a regression, it also represent the slope of the regression equation, or sensitivity of an asset return to variations in the broad market’s return and it can be translated as the risk each dollar invested an asset i adds to the market portfolio.
As Fama and French (1992) mention, beta can as well be obtained by establishing a relation between the covariance of asset i risk with the variance of the market return. Another aspect of the Sharpe-Lintner model is the expected return on assets with zero beta. A risky asset return is not correlated with the market, therefore the zero beta, where the average of covariance between the zero beta asset and the returns on other assets balances the variance of the asset’s return. So to say that when placed in a market portfolio, the risky asset it becomes riskless, as its influence in the market return variance is reduced. Therefore, the expected return on such uncorrelated assets, must be the same as the risk-free rate, and therefore we have the CAPM model as suggested by Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965):
E(Ri)=R_f+ β_(i M)*[E(R_M )-E(R_f )],i=1…N

This model differs from the mean variance presented initially, in that expected return E(Ri) of an asset i, is the risk free rate Rf plus the asset market beta βiM multiplied with the market excess return E(RM) – E(Rf).

However, as Fischer Black (1972) discusses, the assumption of borrowing and lending at a risk-free rate is not realistic, and to that end he developed a CAPM version without risk-free borrowing or lending. In his research he defends that the main CAPM outcome, the mean-variance efficiency, can be obtained by making use of short selling securities, rather than making use of risk-free borrowing or lending.
The difference between Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Black (1972) models, lies in that expected return on assets are not correlated with the market. Black’s model address the expected return on such assets to be less than the expected market return, so that beta premium is positive. In turn, the Sharpe-and Lintner model considers that the expected return from non-correlated assets E(RZM) is the risk-free rate, and the beta premium is E(RM) – Rf.

####CAPM Assumptions 
Fama and French (2004) assert that CAPM relates expected asset returns to their respective market betas, based in a mean-variance efficiency portfolio. They claim that the efficiency of a market portfolio under the light of the discussed models is based in many unrealistic assumptions such as the complete agreement, the risk-free borrowing and lending, or the short selling. Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) CAPM model is built on top of some underlying assumptions:
	Investors desire to maximize their expected returns, while being averse to risk;
	Variance in the asset’s return is appropriate to define its associated risk, therefore being the return’s statistical distribution known to investors;
	All investors share a homogeneous consensus concerning the two last assumptions, meaning expected returns and variance;
	Investors are able to open long and short positions across all securities;
	There aren’t taxes or transaction costs to held;
	Investment timeframe for all investors is of a single period.
And what if those assumptions are not realistic? As reasoned by industry participants, many of the aforementioned assumptions are not feasible in practice, whilst others do not bring critical implications to the model. Cochrane (2001) demonstrate that CAPM model holds valid even for the scenario where the returns distribution isn’t joint normal based in some risk preference from the investor. Furthermore, Cochrane (2001) demonstrate that if efficient frontier holds constant, a static version of CAPM model is able to price assets in multiple periods. Williams (1977) for instance, argues that the model holds valid so long its return estimates are not influenced by different investor beliefs. 

In their research, Fama and French (1992) demonstrate that in CAPM model, the relationship between returns of securities and the respective market betas is weak. Kothari, Shanken and Sloan (1995) and later on Kim (1997) show that the discovery by Fama and French, was achieved due to the particular methodology they have employed. In another study with a different outcome, Brennan, Wang and Xia (2004) testing CAPM model in a set of portfolios sorted by industry, found evidence of a positive relationship between industry market betas their respective market returns, with a downside however that the returns as predicted by CAPM and realized returns seem too big for model validation.

Fama & French (2004) on the assumptions of CAPM model, further adds that possibly those assumptions are unrealistic and unfeasible in practice. Securities investment opportunities are of random nature and asset returns vary in time, ideas which are muted in CAPM model in its static version. They further argue that investors’ view of an investment are not homogeneous due to their very own beliefs or preferences, and as such they may chose portfolios away from the optimal tangent.

####Market Betas
But what if market Betas vary through time? There are few aspects worthwhile to discuss concerning market betas and its change through different market conditions and firms characteristics. Chan and Chen (1988) in their research noticed that market betas show a significant amount of variation in time, sustained as well by Ferson and Harvey (1991), which show that sorting portfolios by industries leads to strong variation in market betas. In their research, Lewellen and Nagel (2006) thru an extended research seeking to include a large array of securities, found similar results.
Some authors argue that CAPM’s poor performance have origin in some aspects. For instance, Elton (1999) defend that tests misspecification is due to average returns being used as estimate of future returns. Kim (1997), defends that CAPM fails in the tests performed because market betas are calculated rather than observable and as such cannot be obtained estimates with high precision. On the other hand, Roll (1977) reasons that market portfolio is not observable and consequently renders CAPM not testable.

Modigliani and Miller’s (1958) noted in their research that changes in a firm’s leverage will impact the risk of its own equity. Considering that securities price affect market leverage, the risk and therefore beta of a security will be correlated with market’s dynamics. Berk, Green and Naik (1999), demonstrate that market risk (betas) will vary together with the business cycle, in particular in periods where interest rates are low, and therefore where the risk appetite of firms in general was bigger as reflection of higher risk taking. As time goes by, eventually such firms would “consume” all opportunities for growth, thus a smaller amount of projects remain available, and ongoing or existing projects can be lost or troubled. These dynamics of adjustment between growth and stall, are thought by the authors to reflect the mean reversion effect observed on the firm’s betas. Likewise, Zhang (2005) focus his research in firms with small fixed assets. His findings suggest that in the event of market declines, the reduction of production capacity is costlier than its expansion, however firms which are light on fixed assets have flexibility to better adapt to current market conditions and drive their investment strategies in new directions. In those downturn events, firms with significant assets cannot adopt such strategy, and therefore are pushed to reduce the assets in place, at times in a very unfavorable negotiable conditions.

####**2.2** Anomaly premiums
Having reviewed the background of CAPM concept and some of its weaknesses, in the next subsections will be set the stage for more complex models built having as base the theory discussed so far. Those models are based in the CAPM theory and were further complemented with new variables having in mind to improve returns descriptive power. Now let’s verify some of the well documented anomalies thought to improve model’s accuracy - size, value and momentum effects - which were later considered in Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997) frameworks. 


####2.2.1 The Size Premium
Size effect as researched by Banz (1981), at times named size premium, relates to the relationship between a security’s market capitalization and its return. Market capitalization is a measure of a firm’s outstanding number of shares times current market price of its shares.
Kross (1985) made reference to the relation between ex-ante returns and current price of a security, possibly due to the market capitalization dynamics, which confuse investors. Keim (1993) denotes that size effect becomes more evident in small firms which achieve bigger returns, particularly in January month suggesting presence of a seasonality effect.
In their studies, Banz (1981) and Fama and French (1992, 2006) demonstrate that the relationship between price and a firm’s size was statistically significant. Asness, Porter and Stevens (2000a) show that an investment strategy comprised of a portfolio of long positions of small stocks sorted in an equally weighted manner, financed with short positions of large firms sorted the same way, returned about 1%  monthly – a seemingly good risk premium.
Testing with CAPM model, size anomaly seems to persist even after considering risk adjustment. Banz (1981), denoted that a firm’s size is inversely related to its beta, thus could be a better alternative than the estimated betas to represent market risk. Berk (1995) discuss that even in the scenario of imprecise beta measurement, firm’s size factor should have predictive power of returns within CAPM model. Later, Kim (1997) demonstrates that correcting for error in cross sectional tests, the size factor turns out to be a weak return predictor.
Fama and French (1992) counter-argue that CAPM shall account for size factor and they demonstrate that is not correlated with other factors related to market beta. To perform the test, they sort securities based in firm’s market capitalization and CAPM slope. They conclude that in portfolios with similar betas, small firms tend to fare better than larger firms, finding which contradicts CAPM model. Daniel and Titman (1997) mention that cross sectional tests are of considerable effectiveness to assert predictive power of factors.
Another observation in Fama and French (2006), is that size premium might be specific from certain periods, as for instance noted by Schwert (2003) and Dichev (1999) which found evidence that the effect seemed to have vanished upon suggestion by Banz (1981). In Fama and French (2006) it’s observed that size factor effect is hardly statistically significant.
Some other authors, taking on the Arbitrage Pricing Model of Ross (1976), defend that it can better describe the anomaly size, as for instance Chan, Chen and Hsieh (1986) in their macroeconomic factors model; however this results are contested considering that its specification have small power when testing if size effect continue after checking for risk premium. Those study’s factors were not tested for pricing size as an independent factor, condition which is mandatory for a model validation according to Cochrane (2001) and Jagannathan and Wang (1998).
While Reinganum (1981) and Basu (1983) give indication that firm’s size is related with its fundamental, focusing in the market capitalization and Earnings to Price ratio, its Fama and French (1992) in their study who suggest a considerable positive relation between a firm’s book to market ratio (value) and market capitalization (size). Observing the results of their study, size factor coefficient resulting from the cross section regression is reduced upon introducing B/M as explanatory variable. Asness et al. (2000) show that size risk premium is reduced significantly upon adjustment for B/M anomaly. Likewise, Fama and French (2006) arrives to similar findings when Earnings to Price ratio is used as value factor.

####2.2.2 The Value Premium
Value effect relates to the relationship between a firm’s accounting fundamentals and its price, as per early evidence denoted by Basu (1977). The fundamental ratios under observation to establish this relationship usually are the Earnings to Price (E/P) or the Book to Market (B/M) ratio used as a measure of firm’s value. Other studies are which make use of similar metrics which essentially represent the dynamics of the firm’s value along time, such as the Cashflow to Price(C/P), Dividend Yield (DY), or Debt to Leverage ratios (D/L), as mentioned by Van Rensburg and Robertson (2003).
Concerning the fundamental ratio to employ as proxy for value measure, there is some research worth of mention. Lakonishok et al. (1994) findings put forward that Cashflow to Price and Earnings to Price ratios overperform the B/M ratio. In turn, Fama and French (1992) show that earnings is not a good measure return predictor when B/M is considered in the cross sectional regressions, however B/M value effect is persistent upon controlling earning with the E/P ratio. 
The disagreement on why to use B/M is related not only to its predictive performance in the models used, but as well some discussion is held on its fundamental base. In the paper of Lakonishok et al. (1994), is suggested that the ratio is prone to suffer with asset dynamics of a firm, and as well the lack of transparency of the intangible assets. As firms are valued not only by its actual assets, but as well by the opportunity on growth prospects, which is by any means represented in the assets, but in turn might be incorporated in the stock price thus reflecting therefore investors’ view of the firm horizon. Some authors seem to sustain the use of B/M, as for instance Brealey and Myers (2000), suggesting that trustful firms are priced higher, view shared as well by Ball (1978) and Berk (1995). Furthermore, Fama and French (1992), mentions that B/M can be held into account for mispricing situations. If a security is overpriced, its B/M ratio will be low, or vice versa, unless the effect is a result of statistical aberrations.
Almas and Duque (2008), on the efficiency of three modified versions of B/M as return predictor in the Portuguese Market, found that the annual return of firms selected by high B/M using F Score of Pietroski (2000), is increased by a noteworthy 9.2%. Furthermore is highlighted the evidence concerning securities screened by high B/M, resulting in a return distribution tilted to the right side of a distribution histogram.
Asness (2000) show that an investment strategy which use cashflow yield rather than B/M ratio as measure of value, is less profitable. Hogan et al. (2004) suggested that returns making use of cash flow to price ratios fared better than with other value proxies. Nonetheless, despite suggestions of better proxy for value premium, book to market ratio is widely used and supported amongst the literature, as will be described in the next paragraphs. As such, in the present paper B/M ratio will be the elected value indicator to represent the value variable. 
Fama and French (1992) running cross section regression tests show that book to market effect is statistically significant and it yielded considerable returns, hinting a possible profitable investment strategy. Asness et al. (2000) in its research selecting portfolios built with long and financed with short positions, found that growth stocks yield returns in excess of 1% monthly. Lakonishok et al. (1994) demonstrate that the profitability of an investment model built by selecting portfolios of value growth stocks, tend to increase returns for larger investment horizons, where in average, value securities are likely to beat growth securities by just about 100%. Asness (1997) mentioned that by using portfolio sorted in a value weighted manner, it reduces the amount of the premium available.
The value anomaly seems to be robust with diverse approaches. Lakonishok et al. (1994) make reference to the finding during their analysis, where the effect is captured by testing with yearly intervals. Earlier, Lewellen (1999) found evidence in his study that B/M ratio can statistically significantly help to explain returns in about half of the securities under analysis. According to the author, the test only had trouble to explain returns of portfolios sorted by industry based in their B/M ratios. Loughran (1997) and Dichev (1999) note that value premium seems to be more prominent in securities listed in Nasdaq, rather than in other stock exchange.
Asness et al. (2000) research concerning value anomaly, find no deviation in the premium size when measuring securities B/M against its respective industries. As well is made reference that deviations from this findings are insignificant while testing with similar fundamental ratios proxy of value. Another note is made relative to the book to market ratio, which seems to be less volatile and more statistically significant when used as measure of value, therefore of increased certainty when predicting returns. This effect perhaps is valid, having in mind that a firm’s size and its fundamentals are correlated. Observing the results obtained from Asness et al. (2000), value premium is reduced when size effect is held into account and introduced in the tests, and nevertheless value premium still is statistically different from zero.
Observing the relation between value premium and other anomalies, Loughran (1997) noted that the extent of value premium is different among type of stocks. As such the author commented on the study of Fama and French (1992), by mentioning that value effect seemed to be related with underperformance of recently listed securities, which is linked with the effect noted earlier by Ritter (1991) with the IPOs. Later on, Fama and French (2006) debunks this contradiction, by showing that value premium is significantly bigger in small rather than larger stocks, hinting that value premium was bigger before Nasdaq stock exchange.
An important aspect of value effect is that holds upon adjustment for risk in the CAPM model. Fama and French (2006) and Schwert (2003) noted periods were the model seem to explain value effect, with some remarks however related to different behavior in some periods during the period in analysis. Kim (1997) show that upon including betas in cross section regressions, B/M ratio still is a good predictor of returns.
On another observation concerning value premium, Asness (1997) and Daniel and Titman (1999) mentioned that the anomaly it is stronger for securities within short term previous returns. Seems like value securities with great past returns are a better investment choice, over performing returns of winning growth securities.
Another effect noted by Asness (1997), is that controlling the factors for momentum, seems to increase the extent of value effect. As noted, securities which underperformed in the past period as likely to exhibit price decrease in the period ahead. In another observation concerning momentum anomaly, Fama and French (1995) show that securities with high B/M tend to underperform until they are spotted. Hence, when sorting securities for a high B/M ratio portfolio, it should include previous losers under the perspective of future returns. This findings suggest as well that momentum anomaly reduces the value premium, and therefore control for momentum while sorting securities for portfolios, should increase the extent of value premium in a portfolio. Fama and French (1996) suggest that adjusting for momentum effect, considering factors which account for value and size, will lead to increase momentum premium, and as such value effect can be minimal if controlling for momentum or past returns is not put in practice. 

####2.2.3 The Momentum Anomaly
Some early references concerning momentum effect are made by De Bondt and Thaler (1985), however it is Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) whom formalized the phenomena in their research. They suggest that securities prices are predictable in medium term horizon, by looking back for their return performance in prior periods. According to them, the “winners” will continue to win and “losers” will continue to decline. Their evidence was found by sorting portfolios of securities based on their past returns, and make a split in deciles with the highest and lowest returns. Other renowned studies confirming evidence of the anomaly are performed by sorting securities by industry (Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999), and by observing international securities (Rouwenhorst, 1999). According to those authors, it’s argued that momentum phenomena is possibly an overreaction result of investors to certain information or events. Later on, Grinblatt and Moskowitz (2004), demonstrate that momentum returns seem to have seasonal effects, with particularly good performance in December, April and November. Israel and Moskowitz (2011) found substantial momentum returns across all size firms. The authors argue that their evidence does not suggest better momentum returns within small size securities.

Worth of note that momentum anomaly was barely sustained by academia and practice, like other recently emerged newalties in the industry. Fama and French (1996a) and later Brennan et al ( 1998) mention that after risk adjustment the momentum effect was barely there. Conrad and Kaul (1998) assert that momentum strategies can be sustained relating them to risk, by sorting portfolios of securities based in their expected return. According to the author’s study, previous “winners” will continue to win due to the riskier characteristics of these firms which present momentum, and therefore shall yield bigger returns. Chordia and Shivakumar (2006) sustain that returns from momentum based strategies are related as well to macroeconomic variables, and Korajczyk and Sadka (2004) present evidence that those strategies, performance based in momentum anomaly are reduced when accounting for trading costs. 

On some literature concerning Portuguese Stock Market, Alves and Duque (1996) focused on momentum investing for the particular period of 1989 to 1994, and mentioned that their findings were inconclusive. Soares and Serra (2005) while researching short term momentum returns for the period from 1988 to 2003, arrive to the conclusion profitability exists in short term horizons, even after the risks have been priced in, however the results were not statistically significant. At another study, Pereira (2009) taking on the momentum strategies, arrived to equivalent findings of Soares and Serra (2005), sustaining evidence of short term momentum, but findings could not be considered due to non-significant statistical results. 

Griffin, Ji and Martin (2003) included as well Portugal in research. Their findings suggest no statistical significant profits from momentum strategy for Portuguese market. In a later period, Chaves (2012) tested momentum strategies in twenty one countries; the author found that Portugal has a good performance when considering momentum strategies, being returns similar to those found in Denmark, Australia and Canada.

####2.2.4 Other Effects
Other anomalies are known, which irrespective of not being the object of this study, are worth a mention. In a brief reference, we cite Fama and French (2015) that denoted some anomalies known to cause problems in their FF3F model, such as accruals (Sloan 1996), net share issues (Ikenberry, Lakanishok and Vermarlen 1995, Loughran and Ritter 1995), momentum (Jegadeesh and Titman 1993), and volatility ( Ang, Hodrick, Xing and Zhang 2006) as the most prominent cases. Recent literature suggest the adoption of some other factors; for example Novy-Marx (2012) make reference to an expected profitability which seems related to average returns. Aharoni, Grundy and Zeng (2013) relate investment to returns, also supported by Haugen and Baker (1996), Cohen, Gompers and Vuolteenaho (2002). Securities liquidity is another factor advocated by Pastor and Stambaugh (2003).

In the previous sections we aimed at pursuing the reader with existing evidence concerning a number of anomalies and associated premiums that could not be explained by the original model CAPM, albeit by disguising those effects will hand an advantage to the informed investor potentially increasing its investment returns. 
Next, the discussion will head to pricing models elaborated on CAPM theory, however focusing on more realistic rules. An aspect of this models is that those effects discussed previously are variables formalized in the model’s specification. Such models are known as multi factor models, and they account with variables which are thought to determine asset prices and respective expected returns. The variables mentioned are known as well as factors and it’s argued by its authors that additional factors help the initial model to better build predictive power over its predecessors.

####2.3 Fama and French 3 Factors Model
Eugene Fama and Keneth French taking on other asset pricing theories, developed a multi factor model based in three factors, which henceforth it will be referred to as FF3F. As the authors demonstrate, their FF3F model is able to explain size and value effect by extending the initial CAPM to model to account with the new variables:
〖E(R〗_(i,t))=R_(f,t)+ β_(i M)*[〖E(R〗_(M,t))-R_(f,t) ]+ β_(i S)*〖SMB〗_t+ β_(i V)*〖HML〗_t      [eq.3]

Being that in the left hand side of the equation, 〖E(R〗_(i,t)) represent the expected return on a given security or portfolio. In the equation’s right side, there is the risk free rate R_(f,t), the β regression slopes corresponding to each factor, and the factors itself. [〖E(R〗_(M,t))-R_(f,t) ] is the excess return of the market over the risk free rate, 〖SMB〗_t  is the size factor and 〖HML〗_t is the value factor.
Having in mind that fundamental ratios are correlated between them, Fama and French (1993) tweaked the sorting method so that HML value premium is independent of size premium captured by SMB. Nonetheless more on the model’s calculation and testing will be elaborated in the chapter Methodology.

There were many critics to the model as presented by FF, arguing that size and value premiums are of too big a size to be explained by risk solely. Lakonishok et al. (1994) argue for instance that a portfolio of long and short positions kept for five years, seem to always provide positive returns. In the same paper, the authors show that the value strategy has better performance than growth strategy in periods of market turmoil, while in good times the model is generally more profitable. The finding is robust with other research carried on in international markets by Liew and Vassalau (2000). In their study comprising ten industrialized countries, their findings put forward that for all the countries except Netherlands, securities from value firms beat growth firms.
Fama and French (1993) show in their paper that regressions of portfolios sorted by size and B/M, along with the market portfolio, tend to produce large intercepts. On the same finding, Mackinlay (1995) questions whether the case of big intercepts in a multi factor model’s regression are possibly too big to be considered valid. The author denoted that intercepts significantly different from zero are result of the asset pricing theory models because their use of the tangency portfolio which has the highest achievable Sharpe ratio. As such, if a portfolio of securities yields a bigger Sharpe ratio than its counter parties from the tangency portfolio, the explanation of the anomalies such as size or value, shall be rejected. In his experiment it was calculated the biggest Sharpe ratio which can be achieved accounting with the anomalies, and his findings suggested a return rate of about 9% for US markets, returns sustained as well by Brealey and Myers (2000). Mackinlay (1995) concludes that returns provided by the three factor Fama-French model, making use of value and size premium, exhibit results too high to be credible.
An investment model which present too big results is not in accordance with the efficient markets, argues Hogan et al. (2004). Based in the tests conducted, the authors mention that models which rely upon ex post cash flow yield and sales growth fall under statistical arbitrage models. Furthermore, they assert that B/M effect does not seem to oppose efficient market hypothesis, and so it’s dropped the case for size effect statistical arbitrage.
Brav et al. (2004) denotes the difficulty to support and confirm model’s mispricing. Also on the subject, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) argue that the reason why the rational investor cannot properly balance the idea of mispricing, is most probably due to difficulties in inform properly about the real returns of their very own models to the capital investors, and as such markets will be kept efficient in one hand, and in another arbitrage situations will be very hard to disguise. 

In a paper by Ferson, Sarkissian and Simin (1999), where the authors research anomaly premiums and factors that try to capture them, they demonstrate that in the scenario of spurious anomaly being present in data, and there is a factor in the model able to capture it, then performing the tests of Fama and French (1993, 1995, 1996) on such data should yield similar results as those present in the mentioned literature. In addition, they stress the importance of performing tests with out-of-sample data. As well it’s denoted that repetition of FF3M tests by using other testing factors (i.e. C/P) in a portfolio that was initially sorted based on certain characteristics (i.e. B/M), does not provide satisfactory evidence about that model, because these factors might be high correlated between them and as such test results are biased.
Nonetheless Fama and French (2006), in an extended test period taking data starting at 1929, demonstrate that factors as size and value show a similar level across periods. Likewise, Davis et al. (2000) demonstrate that the FF3F model is good explaining returns in the period before 1963, and observes the presence of small residual variation, because the time series regressions return a R-squared of about 0.90. As well, intercepts from the regression are of small significance. As final note, the author mentions that the portfolio of small growth securities seems to be overpriced by the FF3F model for the whole period of study, before and after 1963.
Observing literature about international evidence of the FF3F model, many other research has been conducted trying to replicate those findings of US markets for different geographies. Daniel, Titman and Wei (2001), in their study concerning Japanese stock markets, find that the time series regression of FF3F in portfolios sorted by size and value, produces smaller return errors that of US data. More, joint significance tests on the intercepts do not reject the model. Griffin (2002) in a similar portfolio setup, demonstrate that FF3F model has similar performance for UK and Canada stock markets, by yielding small pricing error and high R-squared in their time series regressions. Drew, Naughton and Veeragavan (2003) taking on the Chinese stock market, show that FF3F model is able to explain value and size premium.
Looking into the value premium as further support for the FF3F, Cohen, et al. (2003), found evidence that HML might be predictable. As consequence, output from their regressions can be taken as expectation of the value factor, and as such the mean of estimated HML shall confirm the factor premium is valid. Looking into their regression estimates, value premiums are greater than zero. However their study presented a caveat, as they did not performed statistical tests. In another attempt to support the value factor premium, Chen, Petkova and Zhang (2005) findings reveal an HML estimate returning more than 5% yearly, with strong statistical significance.

Literature findings are mixed, and as such other tests are that fail to support the FF3F model. Fama and French (1997) brought evidence that factor loadings of industries tend to change over time, supported as well by Ferson and Harvey (1999), that present confirmation of stochastic behavior of HML and SMB factors, thus raising doubts on the model’s reliability. A model’s success depends on its ability to estimate with small pricing errors (Fama and French 1993, 1995, 1996). Standard tests show generally unconditional pricing errors, but say very little concerning the extent of the FF3F model’s alphas. On the subject, Ferson and Harvey (1999) investigated if these conditional pricing errors are significantly different from zero, and found their hypotheses rejected. The time series intercept from the portfolio factors are statistically significant and different from zero for all the tests except one. Lewellen and Nagel (2006) arrive to similar findings on their equivalent test with CAPM model. Novy-Marx (2012) argue that FF3F is not a complete model as its factors fail to explain much of the returns associated with profitability and investment effects.

####2.4 Fama-French-Carhart Four Factors Model
Taking on the early evidence of momentum in securities, and the fact that FF3M could not explain the effect as presented by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), Carhart (1997) further studied the phenomena in his research concerning mutual funds’ performance that follow an investment strategy focused on securities past performance – the momentum premium after all. Therefore, Carhart building on the FF3F model, implemented the additional momentum factor:
〖E(R〗_(i,t))=R_(f,t)+ β_(i M)*[〖E(R〗_(M,t))-R_(f,t) ]+ β_(i S)*〖SMB〗_t+ β_(i V)*〖HML〗_t+β_(i V)*〖MOM〗_t     [eq.4]

Like in the FF3F model represented by equation 3, in the left hand side of the equation there is 〖E(R〗_(i,t)) that represent the expected return on a given security or portfolio. In the equation’s right side, there is the risk free rate R_(f,t), the β regression slopes corresponding to each factor, and the factors itself. [〖E(R〗_(M,t))-R_(f,t) ] is the excess return of the market over the risk free rate, 〖SMB〗_t  is the size factor and 〖HML〗_t is the value factor and the Carhart’s added momentum factor 〖MOM〗_t.Note that more on the model’s calculation and testing will be elaborated in the chapter Methodology.
Carhart (1997) asserts that a return of about 8% per year is achieved by buying stocks which performed well in the past period, conversely shorting stocks which underperformed in the previous period. Additionally he denotes significant impact in performance when accounting for transaction costs, fees and portfolio turnover in general, against the assumption of CAPM. Summarizing his findings, he mentioned that in first place funds with continuous underperformance shall be avoided, secondly, funds with great past performance shall provide great returns in the next period and lastly, fund operational expenses such as transaction cost, fees, etc. impact negatively on the overall funds’ performance.
Since the emergence of Carhart’s model, claiming to better explain return of portfolios, some studies have been conducted. Liew and Vassalau (2000) using data from 10 developed markets (US, Uk, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands and Switzerland), aimed at finding a relationship between macroeconomic factors of those geographies and the profitability of those factors as suggested in Carhart’s model. The research presented evidence that momentum factor is not as representative as size and value factors. 
L’Her, Masmoudi and Suret (2004) employing Carhart’s model, studied return on securities in the period from 1960 to 2001 in the Canadian market, and found strong evidence supporting the model. Naceur and Chaibi (2007) researching the best model which could better estimate the cost of capital in Tunisian Stock Exhange, selected Carhart’s as the most accurate. Lam, Li and So (2010), scrutinized the precision to predict returns of the four factor model in Hong Kong Stock Market. Their study found evidence supporting that the factors used by the model are significant and on the other hand intercepts are statistically insignificant, thus supporting model’s applicability to that specific market. They further assert on the model’s robustness, with evidence that is not affected by market conditions, only showing small impact on momentum factor during market downturns.  
Fama and French (2015) remarked that when momentum is not included as explanatory variable, the models fail to explain average returns in their size sorted portfolios. The authors add that when momentum is included, as in the case of FF3F augmented by Carhart (1997), the model seem to perform as good as other models in tests with more factors.

As draw from literature, the debate concerning CAPM, Fama and French three factor or Carhart’s four factor model is not conclusive, and support exist for the case that are not able to correctly price assets, as i.e. Carhart’s augmented model was expected to price in much of the returns not explained by the FF3F. Nonetheless shall be kept in mind that certain assets exhibit an irrational behavior and therefore cannot be expected a model to price an instrument which is by nature mispriced. Despite the models’ drawbacks seem far from disgrace, especially considering the difficulties to explain the effects such as size or value, it lead us to expect that multifactor models as FF our Carhart’s predictive abilities seem far better than CAPM model for instance. In the next sections the models presented will be scrutinized and evaluated on their performance in the Portuguese stock market.
