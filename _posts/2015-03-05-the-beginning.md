As we dive deeper in the technological era of all things web interconnected, it is the perfect time to look ahead in the future and get hands in few of the **many unfolding opportunities**.

To begin with, how we get on that road is not as important as **when**.  We shall recognize that any first step will lead to the second, and so on... Interestingly if we don't put action forward, the rest of the unfolding work will never get done and opportunities will never show up, right? That is why possibly great philosopher Plato once said that "beginnings are the most import part of any work".
If we think a bit about it, how can we accomplish great things if we never get started?

Now you ought to think that you don't possess right now the required skill or means to put the vision moving forward? Or that you should be educating yourselves for a start? Definitely! 

But what if you do those things while going thru the process after getting started. People tend to spend endless time over-educating themselves without acting on their learnings while getting ready or waiting for the perfect time, but there will never be a perfect time! I guess Plato would tell you to quit making excuses and RIGHT start now, just because until you start no progress is made. 

**Massive action is the key to progress**. Slowly as we put in the work, hours turn into days, days into months and suddenly we are performing the craft we once deemed impossible!
