**Regular expressions** are a powerful tool to deal with various kinds of string coding challenges.

They are a domain spacific language (DSL) that is present as library in most modern programming languages, not only Python. Regular expressions are quite a popular DSL language example along with the famous SQL for database operations.

Regular exressions or RegEx are usefull for two main tasks:
* Verifying that strings match a pattern, and for instance that a string has the format of an email address i.e.;
* Performing replacements in a string as i.e. fixing spelling issues.
